## 🧠 AI Workflow

1. **Document Processing:** When a user uploads a PDF, it is securely stored in Vercel Blob. The text is extracted and processed to build context.
2. **Contextualization:** The extracted content is fed into the Google Gemini LLM, allowing the AI to understand the specific knowledge within the book.
3. **Voice Interaction:** The user speaks their question. Vapi captures the audio and processes the speech-to-text.
4. **Intelligent Response:** The LLM generates a context-aware answer based on the book's content.
5. **Voice Synthesis:** ElevenLabs synthesizes the text response into a natural-sounding voice, which Vapi streams back to the user in real-time.
